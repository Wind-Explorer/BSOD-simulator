The system did not actually crash. It is just a borderless window that displays preset error messages

WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOCK THE COMPUTER (Windows key + L or Ctrl Alt Del lock) or explorer.exe will not respond and login screen will now show and you will have to force restart the computer which may cause copprution to explorer.exe like mine

alt-f4 is disabled to make the screen looks more promising

mouse cursor will be hidden

all other apps will be forced below the app so task manager cannot be accessed ;)

only proper way to exit is pressing Ctrl + Up Arrow

This app is only for entertainment purposes. Please do not use it to blackmail people

This app has no virus. I used Windows Defeder to scan the file and no threat detected :D

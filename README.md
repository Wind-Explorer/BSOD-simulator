# The system did not actually crash.
It is just a borderless window that displays preset error messages, serving as a foolish prank

# WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOCK THE COMPUTER (`Windows` + `L` or `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Del` lock)
Due to the fact that this app suspends Windows' `explorer.exe`, any attempt to discard the suspended process will result in serious aftermath.

# How does this app makes the stop error look real

`Alt` + `F4` is disabled to prevent users from easily quitting the app

cursor will be hidden to make the crash seem more promising

Any other opened windows will be forced below the app so task manager cannot be accessed

# How to properly exit the app

`Ctrl` + `Up (arrow)` to exit the app properly (resumes the suspended `explorer.exe` and closes the app

This app is meant to be a prank. It does no damage to any computers in any way (when handled properly)

# BSOD-simulator
An app that simulates a stop-error on your windows pc that I spent 3 hours making :.)

alt-f4 is disabled to make the screen looks more promising

mouse cursor will be hidden

all other apps will be forced below the app so task manager cannot be accessed ;)

only proper way to exit is pressing Ctrl + Up Arrow

This app is only for entertainment purposes. Please do not use it to blackmail people

This app has no virus. I used Windows Defeder to scan the file and no threat detected :D
